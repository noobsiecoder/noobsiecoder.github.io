I am deeply interested in LLMs and the math behind how they work. My ongoing research involves [fine-tuning LLM for Verilog RTL](https://github.com/noobsiecoder/VeriGenLLM-v2/tree/ppo-v0#rl-fine-tuning-for-code-models), and I actively contribute to Apple’s [CoreML tools](https://github.com/apple/coremltools/). During my free time, I write blogs on what I find interesting -- more of LLMs, Reinforcement Learning Fine Tuning, and State-of-the-art work in the field of machine learning.
