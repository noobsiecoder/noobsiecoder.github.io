I am majoring in Robotics at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/). My love for robotics started a few years ago when I began to work on hobby projects using Arduino and ESP-IDF to build a six-degrees-of-freedom robot arm. My area of expertise includes:
- 🤖 Reinforcement Learning.
- 📈 Supervised Machine Learning.
- 📊 Data Science.
- 🧑‍💻 Software Engineering.

My areas of interest include machine learning optimization, robotics systems, and building high-performance tools that solve real-world engineering challenges.

Recently, I worked as a Machine Learning co-op at [Skyworks Solutions, Inc.](https://www.skyworksinc.com) where I was responsible in building:
- 🚀 <u>Automated design pipeline</u> - Led development as the sole software engineer, reducing Power Amplifier design phase time by 30%.
- 🤖 <u>ML pipeline prototype</u> - Built a solution using statistical sampling and gradient boosting that achieved 90% $R^2$ accuracy, and potential to significantly reduce simulation time and licensing costs (Keysight ADS).
- 💻 <u>GUI application</u> - Developed a tool using C++11 that eliminated a full day of manual report production for the engineering team.
- ⚙️ <u>CI/CD & documentation</u> - Implemented automation using Azure DevOps and created comprehensive docs using Docsify for the team.

Previously, I was involved in research at [Embedded Systems Lab](https://www.nuesl.org/) in collaboration with Spring Lab, Northeastern University, advised by [Dr. Gunar Schirner](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/schirner-gunar) on optimizing the oscillating fiber's trajectory in an endoscope using reinforcement learning for enhanced image capture.
