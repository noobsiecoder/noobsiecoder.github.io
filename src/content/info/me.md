I am majoring in Robotics at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/). My love for robotics started a few years ago when I began to work on hobby projects using Arduino and ESP-IDF to build a six-degrees-of-freedom robot arm. My area of interest includes Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Software Engineering.

I am doing my co-op at [Skyworks Solutions, Inc.](https://www.skyworksinc.com) where I am working on the automation aspects of the power amplifier design. I am also actively involved in research at [Spring Lab](https://www.sites.google.com/view/springlabnu/), where I am working with [Dr. Gunar Schirner](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/schirner-gunar) on optimizing the oscillating fiber's trajectory in an endoscope using reinforcement learning for enhanced image capture.
