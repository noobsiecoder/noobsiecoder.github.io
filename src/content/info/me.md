I am majoring in Robotics at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/). My love for robotics started a few years ago when I began to work on hobby projects using Arduino and ESP-IDF to build a six-degrees-of-freedom robot arm. My area of expertise includes:
- 🤖 Reinforcement Learning.
- 📈 Supervised Machine Learning.
- 📊 Data Science.
- 🧑‍💻 Software Engineering.

My area of interest include machine learning optimization, robotics systems, and building high-performance tools that solve real-world engineering challenges. 

From Spring to Summer, I worked as a Machine Learning co-op at [Skyworks Solutions, Inc.](https://www.skyworksinc.com), where I was responsible in building an automation pipeline tool to streamline post-design processes and leverage ML to reduce design simulation time. I was involved in research at [Embedded Systems Lab](https://www.nuesl.org/) in collaboration with Spring Lab, Northeastern University, advised by [Dr. Gunar Schirner](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/schirner-gunar) on optimizing the oscillating fiber's trajectory in an endoscope using reinforcement learning for enhanced image capture.
