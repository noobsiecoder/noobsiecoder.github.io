I am deeply interested in LLMs and the math behind how they work. My ongoing research involves [fine-tuning LLM for Verilog RTL](https://github.com/noobsiecoder/VeriGenLLM-v2/tree/ppo-v0#rl-fine-tuning-for-code-models), and I actively contribute to Appleâ€™s [CoreML tools](https://github.com/apple/coremltools/).
