title: About Me
---

I am majoring in Robotics at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/). My love for robotics started a few years ago when I began to work on hobby projects using Arduino and ESP-IDF to build a six-degrees-of-freedom robot arm. My area of interest includes Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Software Engineering.

Currently, I am involved in research at [Spring Lab](https://www.sites.google.com/view/springlabnu/), where I am working with [Dr. Gunar Schirner](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/schirner-gunar) on optimizing the oscillating fiber in an endoscope using reinforcement learning for enhanced image capture. Soon, I will be starting my co-op at [Skyworks Solutions, Inc.](https://www.skyworksinc.com) as a PA Design engineer. Previously, I worked as a software engineer at [Zoho Corporation](https://www.zoho.com/), a major SaaS company based in India.
